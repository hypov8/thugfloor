-cashdrop should be default 10 (got example code in kpzmod)
-bug, enemies drop weapon and it respawn :/
-maxplayers that can play is 6 or 8? (6 is default in kf) after that it only joins spec
-players still can kill each other void T_Damage and void T_DamageMDX  (got example code in kpzmod)
-but sounds and maybe talking need to be fixed (not tested, see coop mod)
-don't drop cash of spec in first round









pawn o guy should have godmodus but there was some fix in coop mod that he doesn't shoot back
don't think holster should be needed. (Maybe that people can not shoot weapon)
you want to drop weapons for other players
