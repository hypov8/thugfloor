killa:
1. if you elect admin the buy guy wont show and u get stuck on a wave (i don't find this bug)
2. there is a 100% cpu that crashes the server


kila suggestions:
1. a message informing u that you start game at next wave while in spec
2.increase spawn rate of npc at first wave
3. 2x killing enemy should result in cash being distributed percentage of damage given to enemy
2x players
3. boss need to be hightlighted more obvious
4. radar disapears on occasions
5.when a player dies, enemy reduce in size accordingly
the first wave deff takes too long
maybe half the enemy and give players 100 bucks at start?
and later waves more enemy but less health for enemy
